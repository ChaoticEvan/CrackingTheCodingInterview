# CrackingTheCodingInterview
Whiteboad and code attempts/solutions for Cracking the Coding Interview 6th edition.
## Whiteboard Solutions
All of my white board steps were recorded in one note with a digital pen. 
Then saved as a PDF under the corresponding project (i.e. The Arrays and Strings solutions will be under the ArraysAndStrings project folder).
## Code Solutions
First, I added some black-box tests to run against my code.
Then I started with a brute-force solution to all of the questions asked. Then attempted to make optimizations as needed.
If I came up with the correct or optimal solution I left it as is. If I did not and needed additional help from the book, I made an extra method stating such.
The running time and space complexity are in the method header comments of each algorithm
